When validating data, you often need to analyze specific subsets or segments of your data
separately. Maybe you want to ensure that data quality meets standards in each geographic region,
for each product category, or across different time periods. This is where the `segments=` argument
can be useful.

## Understanding Data Segmentation

Data segmentation lets you split a validation step into multiple segments, with each segment
receiving its own validation step. Rather than validating an entire table at once, you could instead
validate different partitions separately and get separate results for each.

The `segments=` argument is available in many validation methods; typically it's in those methods
that check values within rows, and those methods that examine entire rows (`rows_distinct()`,
`rows_complete()`). When you use it, Pointblank will:

1. Split your data according to your segmentation criteria
2. Run the validation separately on each segment
3. Report results individually for each segment

Let's explore how to use the `segments=` argument through a few practical examples.

## Basic Segmentation by Column Values

The simplest way to segment data is by the unique values in a column. For the upcoming demo, we'll
use the `small_table` dataset, which contains a categorical-value column called `f`.

First, let's preview the dataset:

```{python}
table = pb.load_dataset()
pb.preview(table)
```

Now, let's validate that values in column `d` are greater than `100`, but we'll also segment the
validation by the categorical values in column `f`:

```{python}
validation_1 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(),
        tbl_name="small_table",
        label="Segmented validation by category"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="d",
        value=100,
        segments="f"  # Segment by values in column f
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_1
```

In the validation report, notice that instead of a single validation step, we have multiple steps:
one for each unique value in the `f` column. This allows us to examine data quality separately for
each category.

## Segmenting on Specific Values

Sometimes you don't want to segment on all unique values in a column, but only on specific ones of
interest. You can do this by providing a tuple with the column name and a list of values:

```{python}
validation_2 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(),
        tbl_name="small_table",
        label="Segmented validation on specific categories"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="d",
        value=100,
        segments=("f", ["low", "high"])  # Only segment on "low" and "high" values in column `f`
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_2
```

In this example, we only create validation steps for the `"low"` and `"high"` segments, ignoring any
rows with `f` equal to `"mid"`.

## Multiple Segmentation Criteria

For more complex segmentation, you can provide a list of columns or column-value tuples. This
creates segments based on combinations of criteria:

```{python}
validation_3 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(),
        tbl_name="small_table",
        label="Multiple segmentation criteria"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="d",
        value=100,
        segments=["f", ("a", [1, 2])]  # Segment by values in `f` AND specific values in `a`
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_3
```

This creates validation steps for each combination of values in column `f` and the specified values
in column `a`.

## Segmentation with Preprocessing

You can combine segmentation with preprocessing for powerful and flexible validations. All
preprocessing is applied before segmentation occurs, which means you can create derived columns to
segment on:

```{python}
import polars as pl

validation_4 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(tbl_type="polars"),
        tbl_name="small_table",
        label="Segmentation with preprocessing",
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="d",
        value=100,
        pre=lambda df: df.with_columns(
            d_category=pl.when(pl.col("d") > 150).then(pl.lit("high")).otherwise(pl.lit("low"))
        ),
        segments="d_category",  # Segment by the computed column generated via `pre=`
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_4
```

In this example, we first create a derived column `d_category` based on whether `d` is greater than
`150`. Then, we segment our validation based on this derived column by using
`segments="d_category"`.

## When to Use Segmentation

Segmentation is particularly useful when:

1. **Data quality standards vary by group**: different regions, product lines, or customer segments
might have different acceptable thresholds

2. **Identifying problem areas**: segmentation helps pinpoint exactly where data quality issues
exist, rather than just knowing that some issue exists somewhere in the data

3. **Generating detailed reports**: by segmenting, you get more granular reporting that can be
shared with different stakeholders responsible for different parts of the data

4. **Tracking improvements over time**: segmented validations make it easier to see if data quality
is improving in specific areas that were previously problematic

## Segmentation vs. Multiple Validation Steps

So why use segmentation instead of just creating separate validation steps for each segment using
filtering in the `pre=` argument? Well, segmentation offers several nice advantages:

1. **Conciseness**: you define your validation logic once, not repeatedly for each segment
2. **Consistency**: we can be certain that the same validation is applied uniformly across segments
3. **Clarity**: the validation report will clearly organize results by segment (with extra labeling)
4. **Convenience**: there's no need to manually extract and filter subsets of your data

## Practical Example: Validating Sales Data by Region and Product Type

Let's see a more realistic example where we validate sales data segmented by both region and product
type:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample sales dataset
np.random.seed(123)

# Create a simple sales dataset
sales_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "region": np.random.choice(["North", "South", "East", "West"], 100),
    "product_type": np.random.choice(["Electronics", "Clothing", "Food"], 100),
    "units_sold": np.random.randint(5, 100, 100),
    "revenue": np.random.uniform(100, 10000, 100),
    "cost": np.random.uniform(50, 5000, 100)
})

# Calculate profit
sales_data["profit"] = sales_data["revenue"] - sales_data["cost"]
sales_data["profit_margin"] = sales_data["profit"] / sales_data["revenue"]

# Preview the dataset
pb.preview(sales_data)
```

Now, let's validate that profit margins are above 20% across different regions and product types:

```{python}
validation_5 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=sales_data,
        tbl_name="sales_data",
        label="Sales data validation by region and product"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="profit_margin",
        value=0.2,
        segments=["region", "product_type"],
        brief="Profit margin > 20% check"
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_5
```

This validation gives us a detailed breakdown of profit margin performance across the different
regions and product types, making it easy to identify areas that need attention.

## Best Practices for Segmentation

Effective data segmentation requires thoughtful planning about how to divide your data in ways that
make sense for your validation needs. When implementing segmentation in your data validation
workflow, consider these key principles:

1. **Choose meaningful segments**: select segmentation columns that align with your business logic
and organizational structure

2. **Use preprocessing when needed**: if your raw data doesn't have good segmentation columns,
create them through preprocessing (with the `pre=` argument)

3. **Combine with actions**: for critical segments, define segment-specific actions using the
`actions=` parameter to respond to validation failures.

By implementing these best practices, you'll create more targeted, maintainable, and actionable data
validations. Segmentation becomes most powerful when it aligns with natural divisions in your data
and analytical processes, allowing for more precise identification of quality issues while
maintaining a unified validation framework.
