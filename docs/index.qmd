_Data validation made beautiful and powerful_

</div>

Pointblank is a modern data validation framework for Python that helps you trust your data with confidence. It provides a fluent, expressive API to validate your data against a wide range of constraints and presents results in beautiful, interactive reports.

Whether you're a data scientist, data engineer, or analyst, Pointblank helps you catch data quality issues before they impact your analyses or downstream systems.

## Getting Started

Let's take a Polars DataFrame and validate it against a set of constraints. We do that by using the
`Validate` class along with adding validation steps:

```python
import pointblank as pb

validation = (
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table")) # Use Validate() to start
    .col_vals_gt(columns="d", value=100)       # STEP 1      |
    .col_vals_le(columns="c", value=5)         # STEP 2      | <-- Build up a validation plan
    .col_exists(columns=["date", "date_time"]) # STEPS 3 & 4 |
    .interrogate() # This will execute all validation steps and collect intel
)

validation
```

</div>

## Real-World Example

```python
import pointblank as pb
import polars as pl

# Load your data
sales_data = pl.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Create a comprehensive validation
validation = (
    pb.Validate(data=sales_data)
    .col_vals_between(            # Check numeric ranges with precision
        columns=["price", "quantity"],
        left=0, right=1000
    )
    .col_vals_not_null(           # Ensure required fields don't have nulls
        columns=["product_id", "customer_id", "timestamp"]
    )
    .col_vals_regex(              # Validate patterns with regex
        columns="email",
        pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(             # Check categorical values
        columns="status",
        set=["pending", "shipped", "delivered", "returned"]
    )
    .conjointly(                  # Combine multiple conditions
        lambda df: pb.expr_col("revenue") == pb.expr_col("price") * pb.expr_col("quantity"),
        lambda df: pb.expr_col("tax") >= pb.expr_col("revenue") * 0.05
    )
    .interrogate()
)
```

```python
# Get an HTML report you can share with your team
validation.get_tabular_report().show("browser")
```

```python
# Get a report of failing records from a specific step
validation.get_step_report(i=3).show("browser")  # Get failing records from step 3
```

## Features

Here's a short list of what we think makes Pointblank a great tool for data validation:

- **Flexible**: We support tables from Polars, Pandas, Duckdb, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Parquet
- **Beautiful Reports**: Generate beautiful HTML table reports of your data validation results
- **Functional Output**: Easily pull the specific data validation outputs you need for further processing
- **Easy to Use**: Get started quickly with a straightforward API and clear documentation examples
- **Powerful**: You can make complex data validation rules with flexible options for composition

## Installation

You can install Pointblank using pip:

```bash
pip install pointblank
```

## Contributing to Pointblank

There are many ways to contribute to the ongoing development of Pointblank. Some contributions can
be simple (like fixing typos, improving documentation, filing issues for feature requests or
problems, etc.) and others might take more time and care (like answering questions and submitting
PRs with code changes). Just know that anything you can do to help would be very much appreciated!

for information on how to get started.

## Roadmap

There is much to do to make Pointblank a dependable and useful tool for data validation. To that
end, we have a roadmap that will serve as a guide for the development of the library. Here are some
of the things we are working on or plan to work on in the near future:

1. more validation methods to cover a wider range of data validation needs
2. easy-to-use but powerful logging functionality
3. messaging actions (e.g., Slack, emailing, etc.) to better react to threshold exceedances
4. additional functionality for building more complex validations via LLMs (extension of ideas from
   the current `DraftValidation` class)
5. a feature for quickly obtaining summary information on any dataset (tying together existing and
   future dataset summary-generation pieces)
6. ensuring there are text/dict/JSON/HTML versions of all reports
7. supporting the writing and reading of YAML validation config files
8. a cli utility for Pointblank that can be used to run validations from the command line
9. complete testing of validations across all compatible backends (for certification of those
   backends as fully supported)
10. completion of the **User Guide** in the project website
11. functionality for creating and publishing data dictionaries, which could: (a) use LLMs to more
    quickly draft column-level descriptions, and (b) incorporate templating features to make it
    easier to keep descriptions consistent and up to date

If you have any ideas for features or improvements, don't hesitate to share them with us! We are
always looking for ways to make Pointblank better.
