The Pointblank documentation just got a major upgrade! We've completely overhauled our
**User Guide** to make it more comprehensive, easier to navigate, and more visually appealing.

This documentation effort fulfills a key component of our
[project roadmap](https://github.com/posit-dev/pointblank#roadmap), where we committed to
providing "high-quality documentation and examples" for our users. As Pointblank's capabilities have
grown, we recognized the need for documentation that not only keeps pace with these new features but
also makes them more accessible to users at all experience levels. The improvements we're
introducing today represent a significant step toward that goal.

Let us walk you through the key improvements in our refreshed **User Guide**!

## Logical Organization with Clear Navigation

The new **User Guide** is now organized into five main sections that follow a natural progression
for users:

1. **Getting Started**: introduction and installation to get you up and running quickly
2. **Validation Plan**: comprehensive coverage of creating validation plans from basic to advanced
3. **Advanced Validation**: specialized techniques like expression-based validation and schema validation
4. **Post Interrogation**: tools for analyzing and responding to validation results
5. **Data Inspection**: methods for exploring and understanding your data

With this structuring, we think it'll help newcomers who want to follow a linear learning path *and*
experienced users who need to quickly find specific information.

Here's how the docs looked before, and how they look now:

## Enhanced Code Examples and Interactive Output

Every concept is now illustrated with practical, runnable examples that show both the code and its
output. We've adopted an "example-first" approach throughout the guide where we:

- present code examples early in each section
- show the actual output you'll see in your environment
- follow with explanatory text that references what you've already seen

This approach makes learning more intuitive. You see how something works before we explain why it
works that way. For example:

```{python}
import pointblank as pb

# A simple validation that demonstrates core concepts
validation = (
   pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset("small_table"))
   .col_vals_gt(columns="d", value=100)
   .interrogate()
)

validation
```

After showing this example and its output, we explain the validation process, making it much easier
to understand the concepts because you've already seen them in action. This pattern appears
throughout the guide for everything from simple validations to complex workflows with multiple
validation steps and custom actions.

We've also significantly improved the presentation of console output. Previously, stdout text would
blend in with the page content, making it difficult to distinguish from regular text. Now, all
console output is displayed in a visually distinct container with a background color, making it
more clear what's code, what's output, and what's explanatory text. This visual separation creates a
much cleaner reading experience, particularly in sections with multiple code examples and their
corresponding outputs.

## Comprehensive API Coverage

We've significantly expanded our API documentation to cover:

- **all validation methods** with detailed parameter explanations and use cases
- **helper functions** that complement the validation workflow
- **customization options** for reports, thresholds, and actions

The new section on draft validation showcases how to leverage LLMs to automatically generate
validation rules, and our expanded coverage of actions and final actions demonstrates how to
integrate validation into your data pipelines.

## Visual Improvements

The refreshed guide features:

- **clean, consistent styling** across all pages
- **improved code highlighting** for better readability
- **enhanced table formatting** for validation results
- **clear visual hierarchies** with properly nested headers

These visual improvements make the documentation not just more pleasant to read, but also easier to
scan and reference when you need specific information quickly.

## Dedicated Sections for Advanced Topics

We've created in-depth guides for topics that previously had limited coverage:

- **Step Reports**: a comprehensive guide to generating, customizing, and using detailed step reports
- **Expressions**: advanced validation using column expressions
- **Segmentation**: applying validations to specific segments of your data
- **Draft Validation**: using LLMs to generate validation plans from your data

Each of these sections includes best practices, common patterns, and troubleshooting tips to help
you get the most out of these powerful features.

## Practical Workflows and Best Practices

Beyond just documenting the API, we've focused on providing practical guidance:

- **Best practices sections** at the end of key topics
- **Common patterns** for effective validation
- **Troubleshooting tips** for resolving common issues
- **Recommended workflows** that combine multiple features

These practical insights come from real-world usage patterns and help you apply Pointblank
effectively in your own data quality workflows.

## Looking Forward

The refreshed **User Guide** is just the beginning of our documentation improvements. We're
committed to continuously enhancing our documentation to support your data validation needs.

We'd love to hear your feedback on the new User Guide! Feel free to open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/posit-dev/pointblank/issues) with suggestions, corrections,
or requests for additional topics you'd like to see covered. You can also join our community
discussions in the dedicated `#Documentation` channel on our
[Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/YH7CybCNCQ), where you can share ideas, ask questions,
and get help directly from the Pointblank team and other users.
