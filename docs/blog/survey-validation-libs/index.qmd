Data validation is a very important part of any data pipeline. And with Polars gaining popularity as
a superfast DataFrame library, developers need validation tools that work seamlessly with it. In
this survey (conducted halfway through 2025) we'll explore four Python validation libraries that
support Polars DataFrames. Each one is sufficiently different enough from another, and so they each
bring their own strengths and ideal use cases to the table.

The Python libraries we're covering are:

1. Pandera
2. Patito
3. Pointblank
4. Validoopsie

We'll run through a number of examples with each of the libraries, using this Polars DataFrame as
the table to validate:

```{python}
import polars as pl

# Standard dataset for all validation examples
data = pl.DataFrame({
    "user_id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "age": [25, 30, 22, 45, 35],
    "email": [
        "user1@example.com", "user2@example.com", "invalid-email",
        "user4@example.com", "user5@example.com"
    ],
    "score": [85.5, 92.0, 78.3, 88.7, 95.2]
})
```
