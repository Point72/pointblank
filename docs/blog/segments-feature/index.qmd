Pointblank's [data segmentation](../../user-guide/segmentation.qmd) feature came about after a
recent workshop I gave to one of Apple's data teams just a few weeks ago. During the Q&A session,
someone asked whether there was perform essentially the same validation on different pieces of a
table. At that moment this capability wasn't yet present in the package yet but it was something
that immediately resonated with me.

So, inspired by this need, I went back to work and implemented the `segments=` parameter into all
of Pointblank's validation methods. The feature allows users to slice their dataset into meaningful
chunks before validation, running the same checks on different segments separately and getting
individualized results.

Check out the [Data Segmentation article in the **User Guide**](../../user-guide/segmentation.qmd)
for many examples on how this feature can be used.

## An Invitation

We are excited about how things are going with the Pointblank project and are *always up* for
providing a workshop to data teams (at no cost). If this sounds interesting to you please feel
free to contact me through email (at rich@posit.co), or, get in touch through
[our Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/YH7CybCNCQ). Just know that if you have a need for
data validation, we're here to help!

## An Acknowledgment

I'd like to give special thanks to Rami Krispin for his interest in Pointblank and for facilitating
the workshop. If you're interested in more data science insights, check out
